        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Lelouch Lamperouge, also known as Lelouch vi Britannia, is the central character of the anime series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. He is a former prince of the Holy Britannian Empire, one of
             the world's greatest superpowers. After his mother is assassinated, and his sister Nunnally is severely injured and blinded, Lelouch and Nunnally are exiled to Japan, then renamed Area 11 by Britannia.
At Ashford Academy, Lelouch lives under the alias "Lamperouge," masking his true identity. His life changes dramatically after he encounters a mysterious immortal witch named C.C., who grants him the power of Geass.
 Lelouch's Geass is the "Power of Absolute Obedience," enabling him to command anyone to obey his orders without question, but only once per person and with direct eye contact.
Using his extraordinary intellect and strategic talent, Lelouch adopts the masked identity "Zero," becoming the revolutionary leader of the Black Knights, a resistance movement fighting to overthrow Britannia's imperial rule.
 His ultimate goal is to create a better world, mainly for his sister Nunnally, who he deeply loves and wishes to protect.
Throughout the series, Lelouch is torn between his roles as a caring brother, a student, a friend to his childhood companion Suzaku Kururugi, and a ruthless revolutionary leader. His actions often put him at the center of complex political and moral dilemmas.
 Despite his sometimes cold and calculated methods, Lelouch exhibits strong inner conflict, displaying deep remorse and human vulnerability beneath his mask.
A pivotal moment in the series occurs when Lelouch accidentally activates his Geass permanently during a confrontation with his half-sister Euphemia, leading to a tragic massacre that escalates the conflict dramatically. Over time, Lelouch becomes the Emperor of Britannia, orchestrating a grand plan called the "Zero Requiem" to bring lasting peace.
Lelouchâ€™s character is marked by brilliance, charisma, and a dramatic flair, making him a compelling anti-hero who challenges the status quo at great personal sacrifice. His journey explores themes of power, sacrifice, justice, and the cost of rebellion.
In sum, Lelouch Lamperouge is a complex, multi-dimensional character whose story bridges intense action with deep emotional and philosophical struggles, shaping the narrative of Code Geass as one of the most iconic protagonists in anime history.
