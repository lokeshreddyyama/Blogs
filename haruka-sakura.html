            Haruka Sakura is the main protagonist of Wind Breaker, known for his fierce personality, strength, and determination.
             He is introduced as a delinquent transferring to Furin High School, a place infamous for housing strong fighters.
             Unlike others who seek camaraderie or belonging, Haruka initially values only strength and independence, believing that
             being strong means standing alone. His striking appearance, with sharp features and an intimidating aura, makes him stand out
             immediately among his peers. Haruka’s fighting skills are exceptional, earning him a reputation as a formidable opponent from 
             the very beginning. Despite his rough exterior, he carries deep emotional scars and a strong sense of pride. His childhood and
             past struggles shape his belief that he doesn’t need anyone else. At first, he sees Furin High merely as a place to prove his 
             strength, not a community to join. However, as he interacts with his classmates and the unique bonds within Furin, his 
             perspective slowly begins to shift. Haruka starts to realize that strength can also come from trust, unity, and protecting others.
             His encounters with different fighters challenge not just his abilities but also his views on life and companionship. Beneath his
             tough and rebellious nature, Haruka has a strong sense of justice and an unshakable will to fight for what he believes in. 
             He often inspires others with his determination and refusal to back down, no matter the odds. His growth is seen in how he 
             gradually opens up to his peers and learns the value of friendship. Even though he rarely shows vulnerability, moments of honesty
             reveal a more human and relatable side of him. Haruka’s journey is about more than just fighting—it is about discovering himself
              and understanding where he truly belongs. His development from a lone wolf into someone who finds strength in others defines 
              his story. Haruka Sakura embodies resilience, pride, and the transformative power of trust, making him a compelling and inspiring
             protagonist in Wind Breaker.
