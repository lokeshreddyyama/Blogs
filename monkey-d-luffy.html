        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate 
            since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue
             Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates". He fights
              multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes 
              serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. 
              In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over
            the course of the story by transforming his body through different "Gears"; this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to
             measure the threat he poses to the World Government, which forbids piracy. Luffy clashes with the three kinds of great powers 
            in One Piece: the World Government's Marines and its allied privateers known as the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and the most
             influential pirate captains known as the Four Emperors.Luffy is the grandson of vice-admiral Monkey D. Garp of the Marines, 
             the son of Revolutionary Army leader Monkey D. Dragon, and sworn brother to Portgas D. Ace and Sabo. During the course of Luffy's journey,
            he makes many friends and recruits to his crew the swordsman Roronoa Zoro, navigator Nami, sniper Usopp, chef Sanji, doctor Tony Tony Chopper,
            archaeologist Nico Robin, shipwright Franky, musician Brook, and helmsman Jimbei, who was once one of the Seven Warlords. Luffy's rise alters 
            the balance of power between great powers on the Blue Planet. After two years, Luffy gains a grand fleet of over 5,600 pirates, 
            becomes an Emperor of the Sea, then puts Fish-Man Island and the Wano Country under his protection. Luffy is currently one of 
            the three most powerful pirate captains alongside his mentor Shanks and his rival Blackbeard.</p></a>
