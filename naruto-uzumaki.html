        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Naruto Uzumaki is the main protagonist of the anime and manga series Naruto, 
            created by Masashi Kishimoto. He is introduced as a loud, energetic, and mischievous orphan who dreams of becoming the Hokage,
             the strongest ninja and leader of his village. From birth, Naruto carried the Nine-Tailed Fox spirit sealed inside him, 
             which caused the villagers of Konoha to fear and shun him. Despite his loneliness and painful childhood, Naruto developed an
            unbreakable spirit and a determination to earn recognition. He often used humor and pranks to mask his sadness, but his true
             strength lay in his optimism and refusal to give up. Under the guidance of mentors like Iruka, Jiraiya, and Kakashi, Naruto
             grew from an underdog into a powerful shinobi. His bond with Team 7—Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno—shaped his journey, 
             as their friendship and rivalry pushed him to grow stronger. Naruto’s unshakable resolve to bring Sasuke back from darkness 
             became a driving force in his life. He trained tirelessly, mastering techniques such as the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Rasengan,
             later combining them with sage powers and ultimately Kurama’s chakra. Through battles against powerful foes like Pain, Obito,
             and Madara, Naruto proved his strength not only as a fighter but also as someone who could change people’s hearts.
              His ability to empathize with others and never abandon his friends became his greatest power. Though often reckless,
              his courage and determination inspired allies and even former enemies. Naruto carried the “Will of Fire,” representing hope,
              perseverance, and love for his village. Over time, he transformed from the outcast troublemaker into a true hero respected 
              across the ninja world. His journey culminated in achieving his lifelong dream of becoming the Seventh Hokage. Naruto’s story
              is one of resilience, forgiveness, and the belief that bonds between people can overcome any darkness. He remains one of the
              most iconic and beloved characters in anime, symbolizing never giving up on one’s dreams.
