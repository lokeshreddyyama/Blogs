        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Mikasa Ackerman is one of the central characters in Attack on Titan, 
            renowned for her strength, loyalty, and unwavering resolve. Born to an Asian mother and an Ackerman father, she experienced tragedy early
             in life when her parents were murdered by human traffickers. She was saved by Eren Yeager, who inspired her to fight back, and from that 
             day forward she devoted her life to protecting him. After being adopted by the Yeager family, Mikasa grew up alongside Eren and Armin, 
             forming a deep, unbreakable bond with them. She later joined the Survey Corps, where she quickly earned recognition as one of the most 
             skilled and deadly soldiers in the regiment. Her Ackerman bloodline grants her extraordinary physical abilities, reflexes, and combat 
             instincts, making her nearly unmatched on the battlefield. Despite her quiet and stoic personality, Mikasa’s presence commands respect
              and admiration from her comrades. She is fiercely protective of Eren, often prioritizing his safety above her own, a devotion that becomes
              both her strength and her weakness. Throughout the series, Mikasa struggles with her identity, torn between her love for Eren and her duty 
              to humanity. Her loyalty sometimes clashes with the decisions of others, yet she never wavers in her determination to fight for those she cares
              about. She is also known for her iconic red scarf, given to her by Eren when they first met, symbolizing comfort, belonging, and their deep connection.
            In combat, Mikasa demonstrates unmatched precision and fearlessness, often turning the tide of battles against overwhelming odds. Despite the cruelty of 
            the world, she holds onto her humanity, showing compassion to her friends and comrades. Her bond with Armin reflects her softer, more empathetic side,
             balancing her warrior’s nature. As Eren’s actions grow darker, Mikasa faces painful choices, testing her loyalty and her sense of justice. 
             Her journey highlights themes of love, loss, strength, and the struggle to define one’s own destiny. By the end of the story, Mikasa’s role becomes pivotal,
              showing her courage to make the hardest decision for the sake of humanity. She remains one of the most powerful and beloved female characters in anime, 
              embodying resilience, sacrifice, and unwavering love.
