        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Levi Ackerman, often hailed as humanity’s strongest soldier, is one of the most important 
            characters in Attack on Titan. He serves as the Captain of the Special Operations Squad within the Survey Corps, where his incredible skill
             in battle and unmatched agility with the omni-directional mobility gear make him nearly invincible against Titans. Despite his short stature,
              Levi’s presence on the battlefield strikes fear into his enemies and inspires hope in his allies. Born in the underground city, he endured a
               harsh childhood of poverty and crime, losing his mother at a young age and being raised briefly by his uncle, Kenny Ackerman, who taught him survival before abandoning him.
            This difficult upbringing shaped Levi’s stoic, disciplined, and seemingly cold personality, though deep down he cares deeply for his comrades 
            and values human life immensely. Known for his obsession with cleanliness, Levi often scolds others for being untidy, reflecting his strict 
            and meticulous nature. As a leader, he is stern but fair, earning the loyalty and admiration of his squad. His Ackerman bloodline 
             grants him extraordinary strength, reflexes, and battle instincts, allowing him to slay more Titans than any other soldier in the series. 
             Levi’s legendary battles, especially against the Beast Titan, showcase his terrifying speed and precision as a fighter. He forms a deep bond 
             with Erwin Smith, showing unwavering loyalty to him until his tragic death, and though cautious of Eren Yeager’s unstable powers, he remains 
             a vital protector and mentor figure. Despite the trauma of losing countless comrades, Levi never abandons his mission and continues fighting for 
             humanity’s survival with unshakable resolve. His character represents strength, sacrifice, discipline, 
            and humanity’s will to endure, making Levi Ackerman one of the most iconic and beloved figures in anime history.</p></a>
