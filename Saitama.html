        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Saitama is the main protagonist of One Punch Man, a parody-style superhero
             anime and manga created by ONE. He is an ordinary man who trained so intensely that he gained unimaginable strength, becoming capable
            of defeating any opponent with a single punch. His simple training routine of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a
            10-kilometer run every day, combined with no air conditioning or heating, led to his overwhelming power but also caused him to 
            lose his hair. Despite his unmatched strength, Saitama lives a humble life in Z-City, initially unrecognized by the world around him.
            He fights monsters and villains not for glory but for the thrill of combat, though he quickly becomes bored because no battle poses
             a true challenge. Saitama joins the Hero Association, starting at the lowest C-class rank despite his actual power being far beyond
              the top heroes. His casual and indifferent personality often makes others underestimate him, but he quietly proves himself in 
            every fight. Known for his blank expression and bald head, he is often mistaken for being weak or unimportant until he effortlessly
             defeats his enemies. His greatest struggle is not fighting villains but dealing with the emptiness that comes from having no rival
              who can truly test his strength. Saitama’s friendship with Genos, his self-proclaimed disciple, adds depth to his story, as Genos constantly
              admires and studies him. Though Saitama is lazy and uninterested in fame, he displays genuine kindness and a strong sense of justice.
               He values ordinary things like grocery sales and simple comforts, showing his human side beyond his godlike abilities.
               His unmatched strength becomes both a blessing and a curse, leaving him with an existential crisis about purpose. 
                Saitama’s role in the series satirizes traditional superheroes, turning him into both a comedic and philosophical figure. 
                His character raises questions about strength, fulfillment, and the meaning of being a hero. Despite his boredom and laid-back
                nature, Saitama embodies true heroism, always stepping up when humanity is in danger. He remains one of anime’s most iconic 
                characters, admired for his humor, humility, and absolute power.
