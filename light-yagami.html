        <a href="./index.html"> <p class="card-text mt-3 text-light">Light Yagami is the main protagonist of Death Note, a brilliant high school 
            student whose life changes after discovering the supernatural notebook that can kill anyone whose name is written in it. Highly 
            intelligent, disciplined, and admired for his academic excellence, Light initially appears as an ideal young man destined for success.
             When he realizes the Death Note’s power is real, he adopts the alias “Kira” and begins using it to eliminate criminals across the
            world. His initial goal is to cleanse society of evil and build a utopia free from crime, but his sense of justice quickly becomes
             twisted. Light soon envisions himself as the god of this new world, ruling over humanity with absolute authority. His extraordinary
             intelligence makes him a master manipulator, capable of outsmarting nearly everyone who opposes him. However, the mysterious
             detective known as “L” emerges as his greatest rival, sparking one of the most iconic battles of wits in anime history.
             To maintain his innocence, Light cleverly joins the task force created to capture Kira, skillfully diverting suspicion away 
            from himself. While he is charming and charismatic, Light’s manipulative nature leads him to exploit even those closest to him,
             including his family and Misa Amane. As Kira, he becomes increasingly arrogant, cold, and willing to sacrifice innocent lives                to achieve his vision. His growing god complex blinds him to the dangers of his own overconfidence. Despite his cruelty, Light
           inspires followers who believe in his version of justice, showing the dangerous allure of absolute power. His battle against 
          L, and later Near and Mello, highlights his genius but also exposes his fatal flaws. In the end, Light’s downfall comes from 
          his inability to see beyond his arrogance, leading to his defeat and death. He remains one of the most complex characters in 
          anime, embodying themes of justice, morality, ambition, and corruption.
